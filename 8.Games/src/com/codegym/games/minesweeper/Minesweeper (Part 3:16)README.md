Minesweeper (Part 3/16)



Because our game will use game objects (cells), we'll create a separate GameObject class to describe them.

Let's think about what the game object needs. Naturally, we need its x and y coordinates on 
the playing field. And how can we get by without a constructor? After you do everything, 
don't forget to run the program and look at the result.

Requirements:
1. There must be a public GameObject class.
2. The GameObject class must have a public int x field.
3. The GameObject class must have a public int y field.
4. The GameObject class must have one constructor with two int parameters that are used to 
initialize the x and y fields, in that order.
