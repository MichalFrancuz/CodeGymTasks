// Three methods and a minimum
//        Write the following public static methods: int min(int, int), long min(long, long), double min(double, double).
//        Each method must return the minimum of the two numbers passed to it.
//
//
//        Requirements:
//        1. The program should not display text on the screen.
//        2. The Solution class must have four methods.
//        3. The Solution class must have a static int min(int, int) method.
//        4. The int min(int, int) method must return the minimum of two ints.
//        5. The Solution class must have a static long min(long, long) method.
//        6. The long min(long, long) method must return the minimum of two longs.
//        7. The Solution class must have a static double min(double, double) method.
//        8. The double min(double, double) method must return the minimum of two doubles.
